  Automate adding stylesheets and javascripts to your controller actions

Example
=======

  Any controller will include the stylesheet and javascript source files named after named after the contorller if the file exists:
  
    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      ...
    end
    
    http://mysite.com/users/ will have /stylesheets/users.css and /javascripts/users.js included if they exist.
    
  Any controller can specify any other file to be added as a stylesheet:
  
    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      style_like :homes
      script_like :gargantuan
    end
    
    http://mysite.com/users/ will have users.css, homes.css and gargantuan.js included
    
  Any asset that needs to take precedence over others (i.e. should be linked after the other stylesheets) can be used with a bang (!)
  
    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      style_like :distort_reality!, :homes, :trees
      script_like :basic_script, :super_enhancement!
    end
    
    http://mysite.com/users/ will have homes.css, and trees.css and basic_script.js linked before the <title> tag.
    distort_reality.css and super_enhancement.js will be linked after the <title> tag.
    Note: the controller-named assets (users.css and users.js in this case) will always
    be applied with precedence.

  All linked assets will be cached into a single asset if caching is enabled.
